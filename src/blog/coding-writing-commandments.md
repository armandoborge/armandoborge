## Who is Henry Miller?

Henry Miller (1891‚Äì1980) was an American novelist known for his raw, semi-autobiographical works like _Tropic of Cancer_, _Tropic of Capricorn_ and _Black Spring_. His writing broke conventions and censorship boundaries, blending fiction, memoir, philosophy and social critique. But beyond the content of his work, his method of creating offers timeless lessons for anyone who works with ideas.

## The Commandments

In the 1930s, Miller wrote a set of commandments to guide his writing process. I consider these guidelines are applicable to anyone engaged in creative or intellectual work; including of course **software development**.

Whether you're building an app, debugging a complex system or architecting a new backend, Miller's principles can help you stay focused, productive and sane. Here are Henry Miller's 11 commandments, followed by insights into how each applies to software development.

### 1. Work on one thing at a time until finished.

Don‚Äôt multitask across projects, programming languages, courses or half-built projects. Pick a task (e.g., building an API route, fixing a bug, designing or refactoring a component) and follow it through to completion. Context switching kills flow and hinders your productivity.

---

### 2. Start no more new books, add no more new material to [Black Spring](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spring_(short_story_collection)>).

Resist the urge to refactor everything. Imagine you're working on a module, and suddenly you notice another part of the code base can be improved a little bit, here YOU MUST RESIST. Write the idea or task in a note or your backlog and keep working on the task at hand.

Resist as well the need to add ‚Äújust one more‚Äù feature to a finished module. Ship what you've already built.

---

### 3. Don‚Äôt be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.

Don‚Äôt let performance anxiety or perfectionism paralyze you. Write your code confidently, forget about the time, refactor later. Embrace mistakes as part of the process. Build with curiosity and joy, have the calm to understand each line of code, be curious: What happens if I change this line or that one?.

---

### 4. Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!

Set working hours and commit to a roadmap, get used to separate planning from execution, I'll write in details on this topic in a future post. The general idea is to be clear about what it needs to be done every day.

At the appointed time to stop working, stop coding and go for a walk or get some movement, powerful yoga classes work perfectly in my case; synergetics activities will make you a better coder.

---

### 5. When you can‚Äôt create you can work.

Can't write elegant logic today? No problem, then clean up some code, improve the documentation, write tests, research, understand that module that complex module. Progress isn't always glamorous, but it always counts.

---

### 6. Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.

Build small, solid pieces of functionality daily. Don't waste time endlessly researching tools, libraries or frameworks you're not ready to use. Better to have stable code than hypothetical improvements.

---

### 7. Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.

This one is really important for developers: Don't become a hermit behind the keyboard. Connect with other people, attend meetups, take long breaks. Fresh air and conversation recharge your brain in marvelous ways.

Going out, talking to people and understanding human nature will give an edge when building user interfaces, understanding how people think, how they feel and how they interact with the world is a valuable skill you shouldn't neglect.

---

### 8. Don‚Äôt be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.

Don't grind through code joylessly. If a project feels like pulling a plow, you may need to realign with what excites you. Creativity flows better when you enjoy the problem you're solving.

If you're getting bored, maybe you need a new challenge. If you're feeling overwhelmed, be humble and lower the bar or maybe take time to master a new tech stack, a concept that you don't fully understand or ask for help.

---

### 9. Discard the Program when you feel like it‚Äîbut go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.

Flexibility is key. If inspiration strikes, chase it. But always return to your plan. Prioritize. Ignore distractions. The best software emerges from focused iteration, not scattered tinkering.

---

### 10. Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing.

Don't daydream about the future app you'll build someday. Focus on the app you're building **right now**. Great developers ship; dreamers just accumulate side projects that never solve people's problems.

---

### 11. Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.

Make building your priority. Do the deep work before checking Slack, social media, or tech blogs. Write your code first. The rest can wait.

That's it for now, happy coding! üöÄ
