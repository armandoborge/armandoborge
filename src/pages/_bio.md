Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Armando, a software engineer and entrepreneur based in Costa Rica. I'm the founder of [Tripping Cats OÜ](https://www.trippingcats.com) and Principal Web Architect at [Tribu Yoga](https://www.tribu.yoga), where I develop solutions that empower businesses all around the world.

I've been exploring web technologies and creating software applications with the spirit of the artisan since 2004: When AJAX was popularized by Google Maps and Gmail. At that time, most websites used 800×600 or 1024×768 screen resolutions as design targets, responsive design was not yet a concept, [PHP](https://www.php.net) and the [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) stack ruled the world. The good old days.

Over the years, I've [worked in various roles](/work) (Back-End, Front-End, FullStack, Web Architect, Cloud Engineer, Tech Lead and CTO) at companies around the globe, in countries as diverse as Costa Rica, Brazil, United States, England, Germany and Estonia. Using a wide variety of technologies, programming languages, platforms and Frameworks:

JavaScript, PHP, CSS, HTML, Swift, C#, C++, Node.js, SQL, MongoDB, FaunaDB, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Terraform, Angular.js, React, Astro, Gatsby, Next.js, jQuery, TailwindCSS, PWA, GraphQL, Docker, Gulp, Grunt, GitHub, Zend Framework, CodeIgniter, SASS/LESS, WordPress, Joomla [and so on and so forth…](/work)

I speak **Spanish** and **English** as natural languages, I am currently learning **Italian** for fun.

I also enjoy guitar playing, [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3bSd1BSplY55ExrvV7n3le?si=4f746182075d40c2), travels and yoga, all topics I've explored over the years as synergetic activities. Check out my [travel photo gallery](https://travels.armandoborge.com/).

In 2019 I co-founded [Tripping Cats OÜ](https://www.trippingcats.com), a digital services studio based in Estonia. Then in 2021 I developed [Tribu Yoga](https://www.tribu.yoga), a SaaS platform designed specifically to manage yoga studios (arguably my most exciting venture to date).

Looking ahead, I am actively seeking innovative and ambitious projects. If you have a compelling idea and need a business partner to bring it to life, I welcome the opportunity to collaborate.
