Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Armando, a software engineer and entrepreneur based in Costa Rica. I'm the founder of <a href="https://www.trippingcats.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tripping Cats OÜ</a> and Principal Web Architect at <a href="https://www.tribu.yoga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tribu Yoga</a>, where I develop solutions that empower businesses all around the world.

I've been exploring web technologies and creating software applications with the spirit of the artisan since 2004: When AJAX was popularized by Google Maps and Gmail. At that time, most websites used 800×600 or 1024×768 screen resolutions as design targets, responsive design was not yet a concept, <a href="https://www.php.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHP</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAMP</a> stack ruled the world. The good old days.

Over the years, I've [worked in various roles](/work) (Back-End, Front-End, FullStack, Web Architect, Cloud Engineer, Tech Lead and CTO) at companies around the globe, in countries as diverse as Costa Rica, Brazil, United States, England, Germany and Estonia. Using a wide variety of technologies, programming languages, platforms and Frameworks:

JavaScript, PHP, CSS, HTML, Swift, C#, C++, Node.js, SQL, MongoDB, FaunaDB, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Terraform, Angular.js, React, Astro, Gatsby, Next.js, jQuery, TailwindCSS, PWA, GraphQL, Docker, Gulp, Grunt, GitHub, Zend Framework, CodeIgniter, SASS/LESS, WordPress, Joomla [and so on and so forth…](/work)

I speak **Spanish** and **English** as natural languages, I am currently learning **Italian** for fun.

I also enjoy guitar playing, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3bSd1BSplY55ExrvV7n3le?si=4f746182075d40c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">music</a>, travels and yoga, all topics I've explored over the years as synergetic activities. Check out my <a href="https://travels.armandoborge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel photo gallery</a>.

In 2019 I co-founded <a href="https://www.trippingcats.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tripping Cats OÜ</a>, a digital services studio based in Estonia. Then in 2021 I developed <a href="https://www.tribu.yoga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tribu Yoga</a>, a SaaS platform designed specifically to manage yoga studios (arguably my most exciting venture to date).

Looking ahead, I am actively seeking innovative and ambitious projects. If you have a compelling idea and need a business partner to bring it to life, I welcome the opportunity to collaborate.
